#+title: Perform git diff on GPG files
#+filetags: :git:diff:gpg:pgp:secure:compare:
#+options: *:t -:t \n:t f:t tags:t

* Solution and problem
I use GPG encrypted files within my ~ORG~ setup. However, if I save a ~.gpg~ file without significant changes, or when I only added information, GIT cannot detect this. There is however an option to overrule this:

#+begin_src shell :exports code
echo "*.gpg filter=gpg diff=gpg" >> .gitattributes
echo "*.asc filter=gpg diff=gpg" >> .gitattributes
#+end_src

and

#+begin_src shell :exports code
git config --global diff.gpg.textconv "gpg --no-tty --decrypt"
#+end_src
