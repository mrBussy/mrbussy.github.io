* Introduction
As an ongoing efford to improve my site, it came to my attention that I forgot an import file: [[https://mrbussy.eu/.well-known/security.txt][security.txt]]. According the specification [[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116][RFC-9116]] each site should contain one.

This implies that  I also require one. So time to implement.

* Implementation
First I need to find how to implement. According the specifications, the file should be located in the ~.well-known~ folder. This folder cannot be created in GitHub pages and Jekyll. So a different solution has to be found.

Doing some =DuckDuckGo= search I found a solution: https://maxchadwick.xyz/blog/the-well-known-folder-and-github-pages-jekyll

So I created my own implementation in /security.txt:
#+begin_src
  ---
layout: none
permalink: .well-known/security.txt
---
#+end_src

This is an good start. Time to fill the content:

#+begin_src 
Contact: mailto:security@mrbuss.eu

Encryption: openpgp4fpr:112AF5458E55B1D08CA30537923EAC2A4EAB7F6B
Preferred-Languages: en, nl
Canonical: https://mrbussy.eu/.well-known/security.txt
#+end_src

This is a good next step. However, I want to add a gpg-sign so that you can verify the authenticity of the file. As I use ~Emacs~ as my editor, it was quite simple to implement:
1. Select the region with the text (forget the header part)
2. Call src_emacs-lisp[:exports code]{(epa-sign-region)}

Now it is time to commit, create this blog post and submit to [[https://github.com/mrbussy/mrbussy.github.io][GitHub]].
