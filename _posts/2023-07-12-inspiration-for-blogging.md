# Inspiration for blogging

Sometimes you come across small concepts that trigger a world of inspiration. Today was such a day when I saw the video's of [C'est la Z](https://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/). He shared some concepts of `emacs`. Not only where they inspirational but also functional.  

In one of the video's the [irreal](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=11433) site was mentioned. Here you can find a lot of information around `emacs`.

# Why it this inspirational

First of all, I like resources that have information about `emacs` or `orgmode`. What inspired me more however it the micro blogging structure. Not sharing big blogs of info, but just small chapters with insights, news or resources discovered.

Let's see if I can keep up this idea. Not to get the hopes up to much: I will not promise anything.

This is it for today. A micro-publication today, but I think it is worth sharing.
