# Introduction

As an ongoing efford to improve my site, it came to my attention that I forgot an import file: [security.txt](https://mrbussy.eu/.well-known/security.txt). According the specification [RFC-9116](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116) each site should contain one.  

This implies that  I also require one. So time to implement.

# Implementation

First I need to find how to implement. According the specifications, the file should be located in the `.well-known` folder. This folder cannot be created in GitHub pages and Jekyll. So a different solution has to be found.  

Doing some `DuckDuckGo` search I found a solution: <https://maxchadwick.xyz/blog/the-well-known-folder-and-github-pages-jekyll>  

So I created my own implementation in /security.txt:  

```
  ---
layout: none
permalink: .well-known/security.txt
---

```

This is an good start. Time to fill the content:

```

This is a good next step. However, I want to add a gpg-sign so that you can verify the authenticity of the file. As I use `Emacs` as my editor, it was quite simple to implement:  

1.  Select the region with the text (forget the header part)
2.  Call `(epa-sign-region)`

Now it is time to commit, create this blog post and submit to [GitHub](https://github.com/mrbussy/mrbussy.github.io).
