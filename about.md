# About
This site contains my thoughts and idea's. This can be related to #emacs, but also other scribbles. Sometimes it will just be small snippets to perform some micro blogging. Other times, I could perhaps write bigger postings.

## Improvements
As I do not have a lot of time left, this site is far from complete. Things I would like to add:
- [ ] Tag list
- [ ] Date navigator on the page
- [ ] More content
- [ ] Add better support for code blocks 

# Jekyll theme
The site is build using [jekyll][jekyll-organization] pages for [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).


The site is using the [b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console "Link to the console theme") theme.

[jekyll-organization]: https://github.com/jekyll
